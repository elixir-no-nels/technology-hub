The structure of the development team depends on multiple factors such as the goal and complexity of the software product/solution, developed by the team, available time for the project and the budget.

If we forget about business analytics which are usually the part of the development teams in companies, then we can say that the typical software development teams consist of product owner, project manager, software architect and several engineers including developers and DevOps engineers.

Quite often in smaller teams one person can have multiple roles assigned to them.

However, no matter how big or small the team is, the key element is to always have clear understanding of how roles and responsibilities are distributed between the team members.

One of the most important roles in any team is the project manager (who is often assigned to be a team leader as well).

When it comes to the ways of organising the development process and teamwork there are multiple methodologies. Listed below are some of the most well-known.

Use of specialised tools for scheduling and task distribution such as [Microsoft Planner](https://g.co/kgs/MmUwj8), [GanttProject](https://www.ganttproject.biz) etc, as well as tools for writing and editing documents such as [Google Docs](https://g.co/kgs/DhsoFD) could greatly improve the process of team organisation and project management.
